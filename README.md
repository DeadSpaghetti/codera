# Welcome to Codera

Codera is a free and open-source multi-user content management system for developers.

Main purpose is to offer a solution for developers to deploy their software on their own server. The multi user system allows you to restrict certain projects from public access and only allow a few people to see them. In addition you have the opportunity to create additional admins who can maintain your website. Codera allows you to deploy executables or to link webservices/websites you have created.
